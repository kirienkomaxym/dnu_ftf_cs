```
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0                                                            
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
```
* After this, print following:
```commandline
jupyter notebook
```
* You will see jupyter explorer, using which, navigate to the `dnu_ftf_cs` directory;
* Click on the `README.md` file, you will see this guide in a unformatted view;
* DONE!

### Jupyter Environment Acquaintance
Jupyter is an environment that will be used for the reviewing the lectures and labs. Also 
it will be used for performing the assignments. In this step, you will launch your first notebook 
and run test code.

* Use start menu of your os to find the **ANACONDA PROMT** executabe file, run it;
* Navigate to the folder with repository youve cloned before, example (Windows):

if you have stored the github project on another drive, please use
```
d: (or another drive name, I have letter o)
```
```
(base) C:\Users\kirie>o:
(base) O:\>cd O:\Projects\dnu_ftf_cs
(base) O:\Projects\dnu_ftf_cs>
```
* Launch Jupyter Notebook wih:
```commandline
jupyter notebook
```
* Using the jupyter explorer, select the [asquaintance_notebook](asquaintance_notebook.ipynb);
* Perform the actions that are described inside the notebook;
